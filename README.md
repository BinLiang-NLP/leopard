[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.03863)

Data is available in two formats: JSON and tf_record  
Data is organized into a folder for each task.  
Each task contains 10 sampled datasets for training for each k-shot.  
Training file for i-th sample and k-th shot is named task_train_i_k, and the test data is in file task_eval.  

Code coming soon!
